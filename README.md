# PETAL stack

This is a PETAL stack seed for your projects. It has already included inside
Tailwind and AlpineJS. As an extra, it also contains bakeware, so you may
release your phoenix app as a self contained binary.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install Phoenix and Node.js dependencies with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

To build a release:

  * Run `MIX_ENV=prod mix release`

It will guide you and tell you where your release is located.
